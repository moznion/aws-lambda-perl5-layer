This repository provides the Perl5 layer for AWS Lambda with runtime API.

How to use

### 1. Using provided layers

#### ARN

- `arn:aws:lambda:${REGION}:652718333417:layer:perl-5_26-layer:1`
- `arn:aws:lambda:${REGION}:652718333417:layer:perl-5_28-layer:1`

##### Supported regions

- ap-northeast-1
- ap-northeast-2
- ap-south-1
- ap-southeast-1
- ap-southeast-2
- ca-central-1
- eu-central-1
- eu-west-1
- eu-west-2
- eu-west-3
- sa-east-1
- us-east-1
- us-east-2
- us-west-1
- us-west-2

### 1'. Building a layer yourself

If you want to build a layer and use that instead of provided layer, please follow the following sequence.

#### How to build a layer

```
$ make build-docker-image PERL_VERSION=x.x.x CONTAINER_TAG=x.x
$ make build CONTAINER_TAG=x.x
```

NOTE: `x.x.x` and `x.x` means perl runtime version (e.g. `5.28.1` and `5.28`). You can specify as you like.

Then this command stats to create a zip archive as `lambda-layer-perl-x.x.zip`.

--

Or you can use pre-built docker container (RECOMMENDED!):

```
$ make build CONTAINER_TAG=x.x DOCKER_HUB_ACCOUNT='moznion/'
```

Please refer to the following so that getting available containers: https://hub.docker.com/r/moznion/lambda-perl-layer-foundation/

#### How to publish the layer

```sh
aws --region "$REGION" --profile "$PROFILE" lambda publish-layer-version \
      --layer-name "perl-x.x" \
      --zip-file "fileb://lambda-layer-perl-x.x.zip"
```

### 2. Create a Lambda function and publish it

Please refer: [moznion/aws-lambda-perl5-layer-example](https://github.com/moznion/aws-lambda-perl5-layer-example)

If you register the handler as `handler.handle`, you have to write code into `handler.pl` file and it must have `handle` subroutine.

An simple example is below (`handler.pl`):

```perl
#!perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use utf8;

sub handle {
    my ($payload) = @_;

    # do something
    ...

    # if you want to finish the execution as failed, please die

    # NOTE: must return hashref or arrayref
    return +{
        'msg' => 'OK',
        'this is' => 'example',
    };
}

1; # must return TRUE value here!
```

And there is necessary to publish the function with layer information. Please refer to the following example: [How to publish a function](https://github.com/moznion/aws-lambda-perl5-layer-example/tree/master/simple#how-to-publish-a-function)

FAQ
--

### How to build a Lambda function with package vendoring?

You have to build a function zip with the perl runtime that is the same version as Lambda's one.

Please refer: [https://github.com/moznion/aws-lambda-perl5-layer-example/tree/master/simple](https://github.com/moznion/aws-lambda-perl5-layer-example/tree/master/simple)

### How should it do when the runtime complains "error while loading shared libraries: libXXX.so"?

Probably this because of the Lambda runtime environment (i.e. base Linux).

This lambda applies workaround that includes those missing shared libraries.

Ref:

- https://github.com/moznion/aws-lambda-perl5-layer/issues/6
- https://github.com/moznion/aws-lambda-perl5-layer/commit/833ded09dd460ccba08bd4e176a9bc99ff4ec7e1

However, I think this way is a little bit fragile... is there any good method?
